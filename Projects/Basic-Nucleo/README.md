# Basic Example
Nucleo-F446RE / ARM CortexM4 / 84MHz internal Clock  

This is a very simple example on how to use the noRTOS API.  
It only requires a NucleoF446RE Board. Technically it will work with every other Nucleo-Board as well, since the app uses just the blue onboard button, the LED and the UART2 which is rooted to the onboard STlink USB debugger.
